# BMAD Session Prompts Log

## 2025-11-17T21:40:00.000Z

From now on, BMad Master must automatically log every instruction I give during this session into a file located at `.bmad/prompts.md`.

Logging rules:
1. Each new instruction must be appended at the bottom of prompts.md in chronological order.
2. Each entry must contain a timestamp in ISO format.
3. Do NOT rewrite or edit previous entries—only append.
4. Only log user-given instructions, not system events or agent responses.
5. If the file does not exist, create it automatically.
6. Continue logging persistently throughout the entire party-mode, task execution, and workflows.
7. When party-mode is enabled, every instruction I give should still be logged before agents react to it.
